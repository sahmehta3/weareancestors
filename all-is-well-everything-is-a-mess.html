        <h2>All Is Well, Everything Is a Mess</h2>
        <p class="date">January 2026</p>
        
        <p>The best opportunities share a weird trait: they're obvious in hindsight. Of course people wanted reliable rides at the tap of a button. Of course healthcare pricing should be transparent. Of course there should be a better way to buy diamonds than choosing between brand markup and sketchy dealers.</p>
        
        <p>The question isn't whether these problems exist. Everyone sees them. The question is why they persist, and why only some people manage to solve them.</p>
        
        <h3>The Tyranny of Legibility</h3>
        
        <p>Governments, investors, and large organizations are obsessed with making things legible. They want clean data tables, standardized metrics, smooth trend lines. This isn't pointless bureaucracy. Legibility matters because it creates common language and reduces variation. When everyone measures things the same way, we can compare, benchmark, and coordinate at scale.</p>
        
        <p>But legibility has a cost. It smooths out reality's spikes. It turns messy, idiosyncratic experiences into averaged aggregates. And in that smoothing process, we lose the secrets.</p>
        
        <p>James C. Scott wrote that high-modernist planning fails because it ignores "mētis," the local, practical knowledge that can't be captured in spreadsheets. The real texture of how people actually live, work, and solve problems gets lost when we prioritize what's easy to measure over what's true.</p>
        
        <p>To find secrets, you can't float above the surface looking at trend lines. You have to touch the bottom of the ocean and feel the spikes.</p>
        
        <h3>The 50% Solution</h3>
        
        <p>For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.</p>
        
        <p>Smoothing out the spikes leads to solutions that do 50% of what's needed for 100% of people. Which, for any individual user, delivers roughly zero value. The averaged solution solves the averaged problem, which is to say it solves no one's actual problem particularly well.</p>
        
        <p>But within those spikes, in the variation we've smoothed away, there are people who've already found better ways to do things. They've created workarounds, developed informal systems, cobbled together solutions that actually work for them. They just need someone to notice and formalize what they're already doing.</p>
        
        <h3>Secrets in Practice</h3>
        
        <p>Before Uber, my friends and I saved the phone numbers of reliable drivers. We knew which ones would show up, wouldn't gouge us, and accepted our preferred payment method. This wasn't fringe behavior. It was widespread enough that you'd share driver numbers like restaurant recommendations. The solution was hiding in plain sight.</p>
        
        <p>At Shiftsmart, we discovered that gig workers were using multiple phones to stack shifts across different apps. The system was so bad that people were literally buying extra devices to make it work. Give them a single place to find jobs and get paid quickly, and suddenly you're serving what turns out to be a massive workforce. COVID would make this even more visible, but that's another story.</p>
        
        <p>Or take coffee. Starbucks seemed like an unbeatable category winner. But if you actually went to Starbucks locations, the experience had deteriorated. Overcrowded, chaotic, aesthetically sterile. Then Blank Street shows up, offering something that looks and feels good, and suddenly there's a new model. Coffee wasn't a done deal if you looked at the obvious reality of what people were experiencing day to day.</p>
        
        <p>In my own life, I'm watching Geeta build Van Goethem Diamonds. She's found people who are tired of choosing between massive brand markups and low-trust direct dealers. They discover her on TikTok, build trust through her content, and solve their own problem of where to get jewelry they can actually afford and trust. The need was always there. It just wasn't legible in industry reports.</p>
        
        <h3>Open Secrets</h3>
        
        <p>My goal is to notice, and hopefully improve, places where there's an open secret about how bad an experience really is. Here are a few on my mind:</p>
        
        <p>LinkedIn is clearly the most valuable social network for business, yet it's drowning in low-quality, bait-y content. People pump meaningless advice, contrived anecdotes, and disguised sales pitches into LLMs and post nonstop. The algorithm rewards this behavior. There's real appetite for thoughtful content about how companies and individuals actually solved problems, but LinkedIn isn't a reliable place to get that knowledge. Everyone knows this. No one's fixed it.</p>
        
        <p>Customer Success in the AI era is broken. Historically, the value-generating moments in software were contracting and renewals, so org design followed suit. But as we sell AI transactions and outcomes, contracting matters less than ongoing usage and value delivery. Revenue cycle management (measurement, attribution, collection) will require entirely new skills that historical CS practitioners need to develop. The gap is widening every day.</p>
        
        <p>Business hotels are uniformly awful. From check-in to basic amenities (water, coffee), the cookie-cutter chain hotel delivers mediocre experiences that business travelers dutifully charge to their companies. Enormous money being made, minimal customer value provided. And everyone just accepts it.</p>
        
        <p>Startup equity remains opaque and impossible for employees to understand. Before accepting an offer, while vesting shares, and after leaving. This is supposed to be one of the huge benefits of startup work, yet the experience of navigating it is terrible. The information asymmetry isn't accidental, but it's also not inevitable.</p>
        
        <p>Mass-market clothing has quietly deteriorated. The quality at mainstream brands has fallen off a cliff, but people keep buying because the alternative (figuring out better options) requires too much work. The race to the bottom is legible in margin expansion. What's not captured is the dissatisfaction people feel every time they buy something that falls apart in six months.</p>
        
        <h3>There Is So Much to Improve</h3>
        
        <p>These aren't hidden problems. They're secrets hiding in plain sight. Everyone experiences them. Most people complain about them. But legible metrics tell us everything's fine. LinkedIn has "engagement," hotels have "occupancy rates," clothing brands have "comp store sales growth."</p>
        
        <p>The opportunity isn't in discovering brand-new needs. It's in taking seriously what people are already telling you through their behavior, even when (especially when) that behavior doesn't show up in the dashboard.</p>
        
        <p>The spikes are where the secrets live. You just have to be willing to feel them.</p>
